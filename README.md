linux-utils - standard Linux utilities rewritten from scratch

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A fun way to learn about Linux system programming is to write the
standard system utilities from scratch.  Programs such as `ls`, `cat`,
`dd` and others.  These implementations are much simpler than the
originals.  But it is interesting nonetheless to see how these can
be implemented.

INDEX
-----

The programs are grouped in to a directory named after the package
that it was originally provided by.  For example, the programs
from the `coreutils` package are grouped in the `coreutils/` directory.

    coreutils/
      cat
      chmod
      dd
      echo
      env
      factor
      false
      kill
      ls
      mv
      mkdir
      pwd
      rm
      rmdir
      sleep
      sum
      touch
      true
      yes
      wc

    iputils-ping/
      ping
